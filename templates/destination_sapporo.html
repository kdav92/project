    <h1>Sapporo</h1>

        Sapporo blends urban energy with natural beauty, offering world-class beer, 
        winter wonderlands, and sprawling landscapes that change with the seasons.

        The first thing that comes to mind when you think of Sapporo should be the 
        snow festival. If you like beer...that might be first, but more on that later.
        The famous snow festival is held every year around the beginning of Februrary and
        is held for one week. You'll get to see massive snow sculptures, which are beautiful 
        during the day or night.
