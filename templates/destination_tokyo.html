<h1>Tokyo</h1>
<p>
  Tokyo is a city of endless contrasts, where ancient temples stand beside
  neon-lit skyscrapers, and the pulse of innovation beats in harmony with
  centuries-old traditions.
</p>
<p>
  There's a lot to see and do in Tokyo. If you are an urban explorer this is the
  place for you! Tokyo is filled with many things that all ages and genders will
  enoy! So keep reading and discover all you need to know about Tokyo.

  If your are in the mood for shopping, take a trip to Ginza. Ginza is where you
  can find all the name brand items. Your first stop should be, Chuo Dori,
  Ginza's 1 km-long shopping street. It is closed on the weekend to traffic, so
  that is the best time to go.

  On top of shopping, there are other things to enjoy as well. Check out Tokyo
  Tower. There is a place within Tokyo Tower called
  <a href="https://tokyotower.red-brand.jp/en/activities/">Red Tokyo Tower</a>.
  It is an indoor digital amusement park, fun for both children and adults.
  However, make sure you go in even numbers, most of the games are center around
  an even number of people.

  But of course, if you want to just enjoy the views of a really tall building
  head over to <a href="https://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/">Tokyo Skytree</a>. You
  can see a wonderful 360 degree view of Tokyo from the 350th floor.

  If you are looking for more picturesque ig photos, head to teamLabs. There are
  two in Tokyo. One of them is called
  <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/tokyo/">teamLab Borderless</a>. It is
  filled with beautiful rooms full of lights and designs. Take your time and
  look carefully, as you might walk right past a room!

  />
  The other is <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/planets/">teamLab Planets</a>.
  This has a similar concept as borderless (just like all teamLabs around the
  world), but with this one comes plants and water. Be sure to wear shorts, and
  ladies, best to not wear a skirt or dress, as there is a mirror room. If you
  insist on wearing a skirt because Tokyo summers are horribly hot, the place
  offers shorts for you, just incase you forget!
</p>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.cupnoodles-museum.jp/en/yokohama/">Cup Noodles Museum</a>
  is a great place to let your inner child out (or let your childred have fun)
  by making your own cup noodles catered to your taste, along with customizing
  your cup with a unique design of your choice.
</p>
<p>
  If you are looking for something to do that will take up a whole day, check
  out <a href="https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tdl/">Tokyo Disneyland</a>.
  Plan your trip and get there early, because the lines are long!

<p>
  Don't forget about the famous Shibuya Scramble.
  <img src="/static/images/tokyo_img/scramble.jpg" /> Along with Tokyo night
  life. <img src="/static/images/tokyo_img/night_life.jpg" /> If you like
  drinking, check out Golden Gai in Shinjuku. It is open from 8pm-early morning.
  Just the right place to go if you miss your last train back to your hotel. If
  that is not what you are into, check out the Imperial Palace and the many
  museums Tokyo has to offer.
</p>
<p>
  Last but not least the food! Tokyo is filled with many options for food. Sushi
  is great place to start, if you are on a budget and still want good sushi, try
  kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi), Kura Sushi is fun because every fifth
  plate you get a chance to win a prize, Uobei is another good one, and Hama
  Sushi. Try yakiniku! At a yakiniku restaurant you will grill bite sized pieces
  of meat that you can enjoy with various dipping sauces and sides. Another
  popular place to eat is at an izakaya, a Japanese restaruant that serves food
  and drinks in a casual setting at cheap prices. An easy one to find is
  Torikizoku, but be warned they are always packed!

  summer, autumn, or winter, Tokyo has it all and is the place to be!
