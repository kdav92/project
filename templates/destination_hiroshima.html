        A popular place to go is Itsukushima Shrine, to see the floating Torii Gate. <img src="/static/images/hiroshima_img/itsukushima.jpg" 
        alt="a picture of Itsukushima floating torii gate"> You will have to take a ferry to Miyajima Island to see
        the shrine. Make sure you stay long enough to see the shrine at high tide and low tide. Which is easy enough if you
        hike Mount Misen! <img src="/static/images/hiroshima_img/ropeway.jpg" alt="a picture of the ropeway on Mount Misen">
